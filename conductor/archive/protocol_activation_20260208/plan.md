# Implementation Plan: Protocol Activation (Codify Captain Methodology in Workflow)

## Phase 1: Workflow Specification & Design
- [x] Task: Synthesize the current `workflow.md` with the new Captain v3.1 requirements.
- [x] Task: Draft the new "Task Workflow" procedures including specific Git Snapshot and Triage triggers.
- [x] Task: Define the "Ambiguity & Recovery" procedures as mandatory operational steps.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Workflow Design' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Workflow Codification
- [x] Task: Rewrite `conductor/workflow.md` using the finalized Captain v3.1 terminology.
    - [x] Update Section 1: Project Inception & Triage (Assessment criteria).
    - [x] Update Section 2: Planning & Strategy (TEA strategy mandates).
    - [x] Update Section 3: Ambiguity Protocol (Proactive Optioning A/B/C).
    - [x] Update Section 4: Execution Loop (Law of Reversibility & Snapshots).
    - [x] Update Section 5: Recovery Protocol (Artifact Control & Halted State).
    - [x] Update Section 6: Audit & Visibility (Status HUD & forensic logs).
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Workflow Codification' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Final Alignment & Verification
- [x] Task: Cross-reference the new `workflow.md` with the implementation in `ralph-core` (Snapshot SHA, Triage Mode, etc.).
- [x] Task: Verify that all "Hats" derive their generic behaviors from the new workflow rules.
- [x] Task: Final end-to-end verification of the "Constitutional Alignment".
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Final Alignment' (Protocol in workflow.md)
