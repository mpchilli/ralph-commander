- [x] **Track: Protocol Activation: Codify Captain Methodology in Workflow. Requirements: 1. Rewrite 'conductor/workflow.md' to mandate the Captain v3.1 lifecycle (Source 74). 2. Define the 'Triage Phase': All tasks must start with a complexity assessment. 3. Define 'Safety-Hardened Execution': Mandate 'CAPTAIN_SNAPSHOT' before every task (Source 73). 4. Define 'Ambiguity Protocol': Mandate 'Proactive Optioning' (Options A/B/C) instead of guessing (Source 83). 5. Define 'Recovery Protocol': Mandate the use of 'RECOVERY_QUEUE.md' for failures (Source 75). 6. Define 'Visibility': Mandate the maintenance of '.captain-status.md' (Source 82).**
